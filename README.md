# Mentor Matching

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94791958/230463518-4dcbcec1-ab8c-49b5-8bb4-38f69fc5233e.png)

The mentor-matching application shall connect learners and experts in a convenient and efficient way. Users create mentor and/or mentee profiles that an algorithm matches with a suitable counterpart.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94791958/230463520-673f72a3-56db-413e-9088-6b4b43faadc9.png)

Based on user Aâ€™s preference for in-person learning, location, and interest in cooking, they were matched with user B.

# Setup

In order to setup the project, please proceed as follows:

1. First, you need to clone this repository with the following git command, while being in your desired directory:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/TechLabs-Dortmund/mentor-matching.git
```

2. Then you need to change your directory into the newly created folder called ```mentor-matching``` with the following command:

```bash
  cd mentor-matching
```


3. Then, you need to create a ```.env ``` file inside the ```./backend ``` folder, where you can also find the ```.env.template``` file.

It should have the following properites:


```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key
POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
POSTGRES_SERVER=your_postgres_server_address
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=your_postgres_db_name
AUTH_SECRET=your_secretkey
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE=100
ALGORITHM=your_chosen_algorithm
```

Note: Please do not use the given example values (except the port) and add your own. If you want to change the port, you also have to change it in the ```docker-compose.yml``` file. And if you are not sure what to do, here is an example that should work:


```bash
SECRET_KEY=supersecret
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_SERVER=db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
AUTH_SECRET=secretkey
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE=100
ALGORITHM=HS256
```

4. Then, you need to create a ```.env ``` file inside the ```./client ``` folder, where you can also find the ```.env.template``` file. It should have the following properites:

```bash
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
VITE_CLOUDINARY_URL=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_URL
```

Note: You have to create an account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and create an API key. Then you can add the values to the ```.env``` file. For a tutorial on how to do this exactly, please refer to this [tutorial](https://dev.to/ogwurujohnson/cloudinary-image-upload-the-setup-k3h#:~:text=On%20the%20settings%20page%2C%20click,pre%2Dsigning%20the%20upload%20request.) or just search for how to upload images to cloudinary.

---

For the frontend, backend and the Database, we are using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). For the following steps, we are assuming you installed and setup Docker correctly on your system.

5. Change your current directory to the root folder of ```mentor-matching``` with the following command (if you are not in the root folder):

  
  ```bash
    cd ..
  ```
  
6. Then build up the docker container with the following command:

  ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
  ```

7. After the docker builder has been build successfully, you can boot it up with the following command:

```bash
  docker compose up
```

The following servers are now running:
- Frontend port 5173
- Backend port 8000
